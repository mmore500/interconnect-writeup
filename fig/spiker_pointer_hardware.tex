Arrangement of SignalGP hardware within DISHTINY cells (gray squares).
Neighbor-managing hardware (circles) receive stimuli and control cell behavior with respect to a particular cell neighbor.
Network-managing hardware (interior squares) receive stimuli and controll cell behavior with respect to more distant neighbors a cell has established interconnects with.
