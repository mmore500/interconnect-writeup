\subsection{Node-to-Node Hops per Small World Graph Connection, Watts-Strogatz Construction}

Suppose we have a graph constructed according to the Wattsâ€“Strogatz model.

$n$ edges are rewired randomly with probability $0 \leq \beta \leq 1$.

So, sum path length is

\begin{align*}
n \times \beta \times n + n \times (1 - \beta) \times c
&= n^{2} \times \beta
\end{align*}

In this graph, the number of edges is proportional to the graph size $n$.

So, the average edge length is given as proportional to
\begin{align*}
\frac{n^{2}}{n} = n
\end{align*}
