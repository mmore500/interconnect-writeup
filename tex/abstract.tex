%Constructing and studying artificial evolutionary systems that aim to indefinitely produce artifacts of continuing novelty and increasing complexity has proven --- and doubtlessly will continue on as  --- a rich vein for practical, scientific, philosophical, and artistic innovations.
Studying how artificial evolutionary systems can continually produce novel artifacts of increasing complexity has proven to be a rich vein for practical, scientific, philosophical, and artistic innovations.
%Recent evidence has suggested existing computational artificial life systems might be meaningfully constrained by practical limitations on simulation scale.
Unfortunately, existing computational artificial life systems appear constrained by practical limitations on simulation scale.
Ackley's concept of indefinite scalability describes constraints on open-ended systems necessary to incorporate theoretically unbounded computational resources.
%Here, we argue that as a bridge to true indefinite scalability, practical scalability should also be considered: how to design open-ended evolutionary systems to make effective use of existing, commercially-available parallel- and distributed-computing hardware.
Here, we argue that as on the path to indefinite scalability, we should consider practical scalability: how can we design open-ended evolutionary systems that make effective use of existing, commercially-available distributed-computing hardware?
%We review existing in , and open-ended systems should emphasize interaction between parallel hardware components.
We highlight log-time hardware interconnects as a potentially fruitful tool for practical scalability and describe how digital evolution systems might be constructed to exploit physical log-time interconnects.
% We prove several results about scaling relationships of per-component traffic load of small-world interaction networks embedded on computational mesh.
% In some, but not all cases, log-time physical interconnects yield better asymptotic scaling behavior.
%We describe an extension to the DISHTINY digital multicellularity framework that allows cells to establish long-distance cell-cell interconnects that, in implementation, could take advantage of log-time physical interconnects.
We extend the DISHTINY digital multicellularity framework to allow cells to establish long-distance cell-cell interconnects that, in implementation, could take advantage of log-time physical interconnects.
We examine two case studies of evolved strains, demonstrating how evolved cells adaptively exploit these interconnects.
