\subsection{Scaling Relationship of Node-to-Node Transfers per Connection of Small World Graph on Toroidal Grid} \label{sec:scaling_toroidal}

We will consider a set of computational nodes $N$.
These nodes are arranged toroidally so that, in each dimension, each ...
Physical interconnects

Let $d$ represent the typical number of physical interconnects traversed on a shortest path between a pair of arbitrary nodes $a, b \in N$.
This is conceptually equivalent to Manhattan distance.
In the case of a one-dimensional ring topology,
\begin{align*}
d(a,b) \propto |N|.
\end{align*}

In the case of a higher-dimensional toroidal grid topology, like a two-dimensional grid or a three-dimensional mesh, by taxicab properties the number of physical interconnects required to be traversed between two nodes in different dimensions are completely independent.
For a $n$-dimensional grid, grid width in each dimensions scales proportionally to the $n$-th root of of grid size.
From this point forward, we will assume a three-dimensional mesh, so for a pair of arbitrary nodes $a,b \in N$,
\begin{align*}
d(a, b) \propto |N|^{\frac{1}{3}}
\end{align*}

We will superimpose a small world directed graph $G$ over the network.
Each node in this graph corresponds bijectively to a member of $N$.
Edges in this graph represent a close-coordination relationship, where the source node frequently dispatches messages to the destination node.
These edges do not correspond to physical interconnects.

By the definition of a small-world network, the typical graph-distance $\hat{d}$ (the number of graph edges traversed on a shortest-path route) between a pair of arbitrary nodes $\hat{a},\hat{b} \in G$ scales proportionally with the logarithm of the network size,
\begin{align*}
\hat{d}(\hat{a},\hat{b}) \propto \log(|G|).
\end{align*}

By definition, there cannot exist
(a shorter physical interconnect distance)

So, for a shortest-path $r(a,b)$,
\begin{align*}
\sum_{e \in r(a,b)} d(e) \leq d(a,b).
\end{align*}

Hence,
\begin{align*}
\sum_{e \in r(a,b)} d(e) \in O(|N|^{\frac{1}{3}})
\end{align*}

In aggregate,
\begin{align*}
\log(|N|) \times d(e) \in O(|N|^{\frac{1}{3}})
\end{align*}

So,
\begin{align*}
d(e) \in O(|N|^{\frac{1}{3}} / \log(|N|))
\end{align*}
