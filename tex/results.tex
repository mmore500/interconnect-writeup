\subsection{Case Study: Interconnect Resource Sharing}

\input{fig/case_study_1042.tex}

This case study was drawn from epoch 24 of batch 1042 of the initial set of evolutionary runs.
We initially considered it for further study due to the presence of widespread over-interconnect resource sharing.
After preliminary knockout experiments confirmed the adaptive significance of both over-interconnect resource-sharing and over-interconnect messaging, we set aside the strain for a case study.
The evolutionary history preceding this case study consumed approximately 96 hours of wall-clock time and 736 compute-core hours.
Approximately TODO simulation updates and TODO cellular generations elapsed.

Our first step was to evaluate whether intercellular nature of over-interconnect messaging and resource sharing contributed to the strain's fitness.
(It is possible that messaging and/or resource sharing behaviors might generate stimuli on the recipient or side-effects on the sender that have adaptive consequences whether or not the sender and recipient are distinct cells;
in such a scenario, cells would be just as well off sending messages and/or resource to themselves.)
We performed several competition experiments between between the wild-type strain and variants where interconnect messaging and resource sharing was altered to be intracellular instead of intercellular.
At the end of competition experiments, we evaluated the relative abundances of wild-type and variant strains.
In the first variant strain we tested, all outgoing over-interconnect messages were delivered to the sending cell.
In 16 out of 16 one-hour competition runs that were seeded half-and-half with the wild-type and variant strains, the wild-type strain drove the variant strain to extinction (one-tailed Binomial Test; $p < 0.0001$; 290 S.D 17 cell gens elapsed).
We observed a similar outcome with a second variant strain where all outgoing over-interconnect resource sharing was rerouted back to the sending cell (14/16 variant strain extinctions; 16/16 wild-type prevalence; 289 S.D. 25 cell gens elapsed).
Finally, a third variant strain where both over-interconnect messaging and over-interconnect resource sharing were returned to the sending cell exhibited the same outcome (16/16 variant strain extinctions; 300 S.D. 23 cell gens elapsed).
In this strain, the intercellular nature of over-interconnect messaging and resource sharing both contribute to fitness.

Next, we took a closer look at the evolved cellular mechanisms controlling over-interconnect messaging and resource sharing.
We monitored hardware execution of the wild-type strain in a monoculture population to detect which signals, messages, and fork/call instructions activated each SignalGP module.
We manually cross-referenced this information with a human-readable printout of the strain's genetic program to construct hypothesized mechanism shown in Figure \ref{fig:case_study_1042}.
We hypothesize that cells at the periphery of a registered kin groups send messages backwards over incoming interconnects that induce interconnect-originating cells to send them resource.

We performed a series of four-hour competition experiments between wild type and knockout strains to confirm the adaptive nature of each component of this mechanism.
We began by re-routing Trigger 19, which alerts cells to a non-registered-kin neighbor, to activate a known no-op module (16/16 knockout strain extinctions; $p < 0.0001$; 1996 S.D. 280 cell gens elapsed; \url{https://mmore500.com/hopto/ak}).
Next, we replaced the over-interconnect messaging instruction that triggers over-interconnect resource-sharing with a no-op instruction (16/16 knockout strain extinctions; $p < 0.0001$; 1932 S.D. 223 cell gens elapsed; \url{https://mmore500.com/hopto/al}).
We then replaced all eight copies of the over-interconnect resource-sharing instruction triggered by the over-interconnect messaging with no-op instructions (16/16 successes; 16/16 coalesced; $p < 0.0001$; 1860 S.D. 370 cell gens elapsed; \url{https://mmore500.com/hopto/am}).
Finally, we confirmed the soundness of our fitness competition methodology by running control wild-type versus wild-type competitions.
As expected, we observed no effect of strain ID on competition dominance (8/16 knockout strain extinctions; 8/16 wild-type strain extinctions; $p = 0.60$; 1738 S.D. 217 cell gens elapsed; \url{https://mmore500.com/hopto/aj})
